###Transformer Model for Text Generation

This repository contains a Colab notebook that implements a transformer model for text generation. The model is trained on a text dataset and can be used to generate new text similar in style to the training data.

## Notebook

- **`GPT.ipynb`:** This notebook contains the code for the transformer model, including data loading, model architecture, training, and evaluation.

## Dataset

- **`Input.txt`:** This file contains the text dataset used to train the model. You can replace it with your own dataset if desired.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyTorch 1.10 or higher


## Usage

1. Open the `GPT.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
2. Run the code cells to load the data, define the model, and train it.
3. Use the trained model to generate new text.

## Model Details

The transformer model implemented in this notebook follows the architecture described in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. It consists of an encoder and a decoder, both made up of multiple layers of self-attention and feedforward networks.

## Customization

- You can modify the model hyperparameters, such as the number of layers, embedding dimension, and attention heads, by changing the corresponding variables in the code.
- You can train the model on a different dataset by replacing the `Input.txt` file with your own data.
- You can experiment with different text generation techniques, such as beam search or nucleus sampling, to control the output of the model.
